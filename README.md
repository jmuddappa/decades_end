# Decade's End
An end-to-end data science project currently in development. My project aims to collect data, examine the data and then finally build and deploy a recommender system. 

## Features
- **Data Scraping and cleaning** : Scraped the titles from 35 "best movies of the decade" websites using a variety of techniques. Cleaned 1500+ data points using python and excel functions.
- **Fuzzy de-duplication** : Found movie titles which are almost the same and made them identical. Eg: "Mad Max: Fury Road" and "Mad Max - Fury Road" should have the same title. 
- **API Usage** : Use a variety of APIs to gather meta-data about the collected movies.
- **Future features** : WIP to analyze all features and then build recommender system
